# TypeScript Class Organizer for VS Code

VS Code extension for keeping your TypeScript code organized by grouping and ordering class members.

## Features

Organize currently opened TypeScript file or all TypeScript files in your project.

## Usage

### Command Palette

From the command palette you can:

- organize current TypeScript file by invoking command `TypeScript Class Organizer: Organize Current File`,
- organize all TypeScript files in the project by invoking command `TypeScript Class Organizer: Organize All Files`

## Configuration

Extensions supports the following configuration options:

### Regions

- `tsco.useRegions`: Adds member group regions (true by default).
- `tsco.addMemberCountInRegionName`: Adds member group region member count after region title (true by default).
- `tsco.addPublicModifierIfMissing`: Adds public access modifier if missing (true by default).
- `tsco.addRegionIndentation`: Adds region indentation (true by default).
- `tsco.addRegionCaptionToRegionEnd`: Adds region caption to region end (true by default).

### Access modifiers

- `tsco.addPublicModifierIfMissing`: Adds a public access modifier if 

### Decorators

- `tsco.groupPropertiesWithDecorators`: Properties with decorators will come first, ordered by decorator name, then by member name (false by default).

### Arrow functions
- `tsco.treatArrowFunctionPropertiesAsMethods`: Arrow function properties will be treated as methods (false by default).

### Actions
- `tsco.organizeOnSave`: Source code will get organized automatically on file saved (false by default).

### Member ordering

- `tsco.memberOrder`: Configuration of grouping and ordering of members.

By default members are grouped and ordered in the following way:

- properties,
  - private static const properties,
  - private const properties,
  - private static readonly properties,
  - private readonly properties,
  - private static properties,
  - private properties,
  - protected static const properties,
  - protected const properties,
  - protected static readonly properties,
  - protected readonly properties,
  - protected static properties,
  - protected properties,
  - public static const properties,
  - public const properties,
  - public static readonly properties,
  - public readonly properties,
  - public static properties,
  - public properties,
- static block declarations,
- constructors,
- public static indexes,
- public indexes,
- public abstract indexes,
- protected static indexes,
- protected indexes,
- protected abstract indexes,
- private static indexes,
- private indexes,
- private abstract indexes,
- public static accessors,
- public accessors,
- public abstract accessors,
- protected static accessors,
- protected accessors,
- protected abstract accessors,
- private static accessors,
- private accessors,
- private abstract accessors,
- public static getters and setters,
- public getters and setters,
- public abstract getters and setters,
- protected static getters and setters,
- protected getters and setters,
- protected abstract getters and setters,
- private static getters and setters,
- private getters and setters,
- private abstract getters and setters,
- public static methods,
- public methods,
- public abstract methods,
- protected static methods,
- protected methods,
- protected abstract methods,
- private static methods,
- private methods,
- private abstract methods.

This configuration can ge changed by using the `tsco.memberOrder` setting in `settings.json``. Members can be grouped separately or grouped together with other member groups in a two level hierarchy. Every group has a property:

- `caption` (only for top level groups): the caption will be outputted if `tsco.useRegions` is set to true,
- `memberType` (top and bottom level groups): the type of the member in the group:
  - privateStaticConstProperties
  - privateConstProperties
  - privateStaticReadOnlyProperties
  - privateReadOnlyProperties
  - privateStaticProperties
  - privateProperties
  - protectedStaticConstProperties
  - protectedConstProperties
  - protectedStaticReadOnlyProperties
  - protectedReadOnlyProperties
  - protectedStaticProperties
  - protectedProperties
  - publicStaticConstProperties
  - publicConstProperties
  - publicStaticReadOnlyProperties
  - publicReadOnlyProperties
  - publicStaticProperties
  - publicProperties
  - staticBlockDeclarations,
  - constructors
  - publicStaticIndexes
  - publicIndexes
  - publicAbstractIndexes
  - protectedStaticIndexes
  - protectedIndexes

  - publicStaticAccessors
  - publicAccessors

  - privateAbstractGettersAndSetters
  - publicStaticMethods
  - publicMethods
  - publicAbstractMethods
  - protectedStaticMethods
  - protectedMethods
  - protectedAbstractMethods
  - privateStaticMethods
  - privateMethods
  - privateAbstractMethod
- `subGroups` (only for top level groups): the array of member types to be included in this group.
- `placeAbove`: list of member names to be put at the top of the group in the order specified (optional)
- `placeBelow`: list of member names to be put at the bottom of the group in the order specified (optional)

    {
      "caption": "Private Methods",
      "memberTypes": ["privateMethods"]
    },
    {
      "caption": "Private Abstract Methods",
      "memberTypes": ["privateAbstractMethods"]
    }
  ]
}
```

If you'd like to order special members differently, you can yuse the `placeAbove` and `placeBelow` properties for a particular `tsco.memberOrder` item. If for example you prefer Angular component lifecycle methods on top of public methods, you can configure `publicMethods` member group like this:

```json
"tsco.memberOrder": [
  ...,
  {
    "caption": "Public Methods",
    "memberTypes": ["publicMethods"],
    "placeAbove": [
        "ngOnChanges", 
        "ngOnInit", 
        "ngDoCheck", 
        "ngAfterContentInit", 
        "ngAfterContentChecked", 
        "ngAfterViewInit", 
        "ngAfterViewChecked", 
        "ngOnDestroy"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

The `placeAbove` methods will always apear at the top of the public method membber group in the list as specified (if any exist in the class being ordered) and the rest of the methods will be ordered by name and placed below the `placeAbove` methods. Same goes for `placeBelow`, but those members will be placed at the bottom of the member group.

### Ignoring files

In order to prevent a TypeScript file being organized, add one of the following comments to the top of the source file:

```typescript
// tsco:ignore
```

or

```typescript
// <auto-generated />
```
